# Usage Guide

This guide walks through the complete workflow for running searches, managing tabs, and taking advantage of Grex’s advanced capabilities.

## 1. Pick Your Search Location

1. Open Grex and click **Browse…** to choose a folder, or paste a path into the AutoSuggestBox.
2. The AutoSuggestBox auto-completes from your last 20 locations (Windows, UNC, and WSL paths are all supported).
3. Examples:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\You\source`
   - UNC: `\\server\share\logs`
   - WSL: `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\user\project` or `/mnt/c/Users/You/source`

## 2. Choose Search & Results Modes

- **Search Type** dropdown: Text Search (default) or Regex Search.
- **Results Mode** dropdown: Content (per-line hits) or Files (aggregated by file).
- Switch at any time; Grex re-renders the view without re-running the search.

## 3. Configure Filter Options

Click **Filter Options** in the CommandBar to expand the full set of toggles:

- Respect `.gitignore`, include system files, include subfolders, include hidden items, include binary files, include symbolic links.
- Filename filter (`Match Files`) and directory exclusion (`Exclude Dirs`) inputs.
- Size limit selector (No Limit, Less Than, Equal To, Greater Than) with KB/MB/GB units.
- Windows Search toggle (enabled automatically when the active path and search type qualify).
- String comparison defaults (comparison mode, Unicode normalization, diacritic sensitivity, culture) live under Settings → Filter Options if you want those defaults applied to new tabs.

**Tip**: Set default values for `Match Files` and `Exclude Dirs` in Settings → Filter Options. These defaults automatically populate new tabs, saving you from re-entering common patterns like `*.cs;*.json` or `^(.git|node_modules|vendor)$`.

## 4. Enter Your Query

- Type your search text or Regex into the main input box.
- Optional: Enter replacement text underneath to enable the Replace workflow.
- Press **Enter** or click **Search** to execute.

## 5. Inspect Results

- **Content Mode** shows filename, line, column, snippet, and relative path.
- **Files Mode** shows size, match count, extension, encoding, and timestamps.
- **Status bar** displays match count, file count, and **elapsed time** (formatted as seconds with milliseconds for fast searches, or minutes/hours for longer ones).
- Sort by clicking column headers, drag edges to resize, or right-click headers to hide/show columns (preferences persist per table).
- Double-click any row to open the file in your default editor.

## 5a. Preview Match Context

Before diving into a file, you can quickly preview the surrounding lines of any match:

1. **Select a result** in the Content Mode list.
2. **Press Space** or right-click and choose **Preview** from the context menu.
3. A dialog appears showing:
   - The file name and line number at the top
   - Context lines before and after the match (default 5, configurable in Settings → Context Preview)
   - The matched line highlighted with a blue indicator bar
   - Line numbers in a gutter for easy reference
4. **Open in Editor** – Click this button to jump directly to the file at the matched line in your default editor.
5. **Close** – Press Escape or click Close to dismiss the preview and continue searching.

**Tip**: Context Preview is especially useful when you have many matches and want to quickly assess each one without opening every file. Adjust the context line count (1-20) in Settings to show more or less surrounding code.

## 5b. Search Within Results

After a search completes, use the **Search within results…** box above the table to filter the current result set without re-running the scan:

- **Content mode** filters by file name, relative path, and matched line text.
- **Files mode** filters by file name, relative path, extension, and encoding.
- **Regex mode** – Click the `.*` toggle button to use regular expressions for filtering.
- Clearing the box restores the unfiltered results and the normal "Found …" status summary.

## 5c. Use AI Search Chat

When you want semantic help instead of strict literal/Regex matching:

1. Open **Settings → AI Search** and set:
   - **Endpoint** (OpenAI-compatible base URL)
   - **API key** (optional)
   - **Model** (optional; leave blank for auto-detect via `/v1/models`)
   - Click **Test Endpoint** to verify connectivity before starting chat.
2. Return to Search and click the **AI** command in the command bar.
3. Grex switches from result grids to an AI chat panel.
4. The request includes:
   - Your active search path
   - Your current search query
   - Search type and result mode
   - Active filters as guidance suggestions
5. Ask follow-up questions in the chat input to narrow where to inspect next.

**Note**: While AI mode is active, the standard results list and "Search within results" UI are intentionally hidden.

## 6. Replace Safely

- Enter replacement text, click **Replace**, and review the confirmation dialog.
- Grex switches to Files mode so you can see exactly which files will change.
- The operation respects every filter (gitignore, binary toggle, etc.) that the search used.

## 6a. Stop Long-Running Operations

- While a search is running, the **Search** button changes to **Stop** with a stop icon.
- While a replace is running, the **Replace** button changes to **Stop** with a stop icon.
- Click **Stop** at any time to immediately cancel the operation.
- Cancellation is graceful—no errors or partial state corruption.
- During a search, the Replace button is disabled; during a replace, the Search button is disabled to prevent conflicting operations.

## 7. Export Results

After running a search, export your results for further analysis or sharing:

1. **Click the Export button** in the command bar (enabled when results exist).
2. **Choose a format:**
   - **CSV** – Opens a file picker to save as comma-separated values, suitable for spreadsheets.
   - **JSON** – Opens a file picker to save as pretty-printed JSON, ideal for programmatic processing.
   - **Copy to Clipboard** – Copies tab-separated values directly to your clipboard for quick pasting.
3. **Save location** – The file picker suggests a timestamped filename (e.g., `grex_results_2024_01_15_14_30.csv`).

**Tip**: Content mode exports include line numbers and content; Files mode exports include size, encoding, and timestamps.

## 8. Use Search History

Grex automatically tracks your recent searches for quick recall:

1. **Click the search history dropdown** next to the search box.
2. **Select a recent search** to restore the query, path, and all filter settings instantly.
3. **Remove entries** – Hover over an entry and click the remove button to delete it.
4. **Clear all** – Use the "Clear History" option to remove all entries.

**Note**: Up to 20 searches are stored in `%LocalAppData%\Grex\search_history.json`.

## 8a. Save & Use Search Profiles

Search history is automatic and time-ordered; **Search Profiles** are named presets you save intentionally.

1. Click **Profiles** in the command bar.
2. Click **Save Current…**, enter a profile name, and confirm overwrite if prompted.
3. Click a saved profile to apply it to the current tab (path, search term, results mode, and filter options).
4. Use the delete button in the Profiles list to remove an unwanted profile.

Profiles are stored in `%LocalAppData%\Grex\search_profiles.json`.

## 9. Manage Tabs

- Click "+" to open a fresh search tab; each tab retains its own filters and results.
- Close tabs with the "×" button (at least one tab always stays open).
- Tab titles automatically abbreviate long paths so you can identify them at a glance.

## 10. Explore the Regex Builder

- Click the **Regex Builder** icon in the navigation pane.
- Left column: sample text and pattern inputs with preset buttons (Email, Phone, Date, Digits, URL).
- Right column: live match preview plus a visual breakdown of your Regex syntax.
- Toggles for case-insensitive, multiline, and global matches let you experiment before running a real search.

## 11. Adjust Settings Once, Reuse Everywhere

- Open **Settings** to change application language, theme, default search type/results, filter defaults, Windows Search preference, and string comparison options.
- **AI Search settings** (endpoint, optional API key, optional model) are also stored here and reused by every tab.
- Use **Test Endpoint** in Settings → AI Search to validate endpoint/auth by calling `/v1/models` and confirming the response.
- Settings are saved instantly to `%LocalAppData%\Grex\settings.json` and applied to all future tabs.
- Theme changes (Light/Dark/System) update the entire UI, including the Mica backdrop on Windows 11.

### Backup & Restore Your Settings

The **Backup & Restore** section in Settings lets you preserve or transfer your configuration:

1. **Export Settings** – Click to save a timestamped copy of your settings (e.g., `settings_2024_01_15_14_30_45.json`). Use a file picker to choose where to save it.
2. **Import Settings** – Click to browse for a previously exported JSON file. Grex validates the file and merges the settings into your current configuration. Some changes (like theme or language) may require a restart to take full effect.
3. **Restore Defaults** – Click to delete your settings.json and restart the application with factory defaults. A confirmation dialog ensures you don't accidentally reset.

**Note**: Window position and size are excluded from imports since they are machine-specific.

## Example Searches

- Find TODOs: search for `TODO` with Content mode.
- Locate SSNs: Regex `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b` with Content mode.
- Scan Linux projects: search `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\user\repo` while respecting `.gitignore`.
- Compare error casing: toggle **Search case-sensitive** and search `Error`.
- Narrow by size: set **Size Limit → Less Than 10 MB** to skip large binaries.

## Windows Search Integration Tips

- Enable the toggle when searching Windows folders that are indexed (Documents, Desktop, etc.).
- Grex queries the index for candidate files, then still applies every filter and reads the files to confirm matches—so results remain accurate.
- Regex searches, WSL paths, and non-indexed locations automatically fall back to the custom file walker; no manual toggling required.

## Docker Container Search

1. **Enable Docker Search** – Open **Settings → Docker Search** and toggle "Enable Docker Search" once per machine. This preference is saved and applied to all new tabs.
2. **Select a Container** – After enabling Docker search, each tab shows a "Search Target" dropdown beside the path field. The dropdown defaults to "Local Disk" for normal file system searches.
3. **Choose a Running Container** – Select any running Docker container from the dropdown to search inside that container. The dropdown lists all currently running containers with their names and IDs.
4. **Refresh Container List** – Click the refresh button (↻) next to the dropdown to update the list of running containers without restarting the application.
5. **Enter Container Path** – When a container is selected, enter the path you want to search inside the container (e.g., `/var/www/html`, `/app/src`, `/usr/local/bin`). Grex automatically uses the most efficient search method available.
6. **Search Methods** – Grex uses two search strategies for Docker containers, automatically selecting the best one:
   - **Direct Grep (Preferred)**: Uses the Docker API to run `grep` directly inside the container. This is significantly faster because it doesn't require copying files to the host. Grex automatically checks if `grep` is available in the container.
   - **Mirror Fallback**: If `grep` is not available in the container (e.g., minimal Alpine images without coreutils), Grex falls back to mirroring the container path to a temporary local directory (`%LocalAppData%\Grex\docker-mirrors`) and searching the mirrored files.
7. **Search Behavior** – When searching a container:
   - Grex first attempts the direct grep method via the Docker API
   - If grep is unavailable, it automatically falls back to the mirror approach
   - Result paths are displayed as container paths regardless of which method was used
   - The Browse button is automatically disabled to prevent mixing host and container paths
   - Replace operations are disabled (container files are read-only from the host)
   - Windows Search integration is automatically disabled (containers are not indexed by Windows)
8. **Symbolic Links** – When the "Include symbolic links" option is unchecked (the default), Grex uses `tar --dereference` to copy actual file contents instead of creating symlinks. This avoids Windows privilege issues with directories like `node_modules` that contain many symlinks.
9. **Context Menu** – Right-clicking results in Docker mode shows container-specific options:
   - **Copy Container Path** – Copies the container path (e.g., `/var/www/html/file.txt`) to the clipboard
   - **Copy File Name** – Copies just the filename to the clipboard
   - These shortcuts make it easy to jump back into `docker exec` or your IDE with the correct container path
10. **Automatic Cleanup** – Mirrored container paths are automatically cleaned up after searches complete. Old mirrors (older than 6 hours) are pruned automatically.

**Note**: Docker search requires Docker Desktop to be installed and running. The container dropdown will be disabled if Docker is not available. For the fastest searches, use containers that include `grep` (most Linux-based images do).

**Performance**: Docker searches use parallel grep execution (`xargs -P 4`) and grep availability caching for near-instant repeat searches. System paths (`.git`, `vendor`, `node_modules`, `storage/framework`, `bin`, `obj`) are filtered at the `find` level for maximum performance.

## WSL Workflows

- Make sure WSL is installed and the `wsl` command works from PowerShell.
- Use `\\wsl$\Distro\path` or `/mnt/...` paths; Grex converts them and shells out to `grep` when necessary.
- Case-insensitive toggles translate to the `-i` flag; other comparison settings are ignored because `grep` handles the matching.

## Notifications & Diagnostics

- The Settings page includes **Test Notification** to verify Windows toast support and troubleshoot missing Windows App Runtime installations.
- If Grex launches elevated, it warns you because Windows notifications don't fire under admin privileges; re-open via `explorer.exe` from a non-elevated context for the best experience.

## CLI Mode

For script integration and automation, use the headless CLI (`grex-cli`):

```powershell
# Basic search
grex-cli "C:\Projects" "TODO"

# Regex search with JSON output
grex-cli "C:\src" "TODO|FIXME" --regex --format json

# Count matches only
grex-cli "C:\docs" "error" --count

# Files with matches (like grep -l)
grex-cli "C:\code" "deprecated" --files-only

# Quiet mode for conditionals
grex-cli "C:\config" "secret" --quiet && echo "Found!"
```

The CLI supports all search filters (`--gitignore`, `--case-sensitive`, `--match-files`, etc.) and outputs in text (grep-compatible), JSON, or CSV formats. See the **[Technical Reference](reference.md#cli-reference)** for complete option documentation.

Keep this guide handy for day-to-day workflows. When you need implementation details or architectural context, see `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/build-and-test.md`.
